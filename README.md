## Admins

not implement

# CRUD

create

create answer with descriptions ,list of pictures in format of string

- if NMR , we need number of atoms (or all-zero for no molecular formula)
- if Mass, we need ion peak
- if comlex , we need both
- return a `SpectraAnswer`ï¼Œand put not null `ProblemAnswer` member to Dbset

delete

- delete the whole answer

- delete nmr problem
- delete mass problem

update

the same as create

retrieve

- retrieve answer massProblem NMRProblem by id
- retrieve all answer/massProblem/NMRProblem
- retrieve answer by nmr or mass property



# Backend API

- Get By id
  -  `api/ans/id` GET
  - return everything
- get by mass id
  -  `api/mass/id` GET
  - return mass id ,problem pictures, problem description, ion peak, formula =null
- get by nmr id 
  - `api/nmr/id` GET
  - return nmr id, problem pictures, problem description, formula, ion peak = -1
- get all answer `api/ans` GET
- get all mass `api/mass` GET
- get all nmr `api/nmr` GET
- delete By id `api/ans/id` DELETE
- delte by nmr id `api/nmr/id` DELETE
- delete by mass id `api/mass/id` DELETE
- update By id with information `api/ans/id` PUT
- Search  `api/ans/search` POST
  - if nmr ,then `minionpeak=maxionpeak=-1`
  - if mass, then `formula=null`
